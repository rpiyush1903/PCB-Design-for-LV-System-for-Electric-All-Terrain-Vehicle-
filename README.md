# PCB-Design-for-LV-System-for-Electric-All-Terrain-Vehicle-
The LV System PCB is a critical component designed to reliably manage and distribute power from the low-voltage battery (typically 12V or 24V) to all essential subsystems. Its primary function is to provide stable power to the vehicle's control units, sensors, dashboard, and safety circuits while protecting against common electrical faults.

This project was developed by the electronics department of Team Aveon Racing to create a robust, compact, and serviceable solution for the vehicle's LV electrical system.

Software & Tools Used
PCB Design: Eagle, Fusion 360
Microcontroller Programming : Arduino IDE

# The LV System PCB integrates several key subsystems onto a single board:

Power Input & Protection:

Main LV battery connector.

Reverse polarity protection to prevent damage from incorrect battery connection.

Over-current protection using a combination of fuses and e-fuses.

Voltage Regulation:

Multiple voltage rails (e.g., 12V, 5V, 3.3V) generated by efficient DC-DC buck converters.

Dedicated regulators for noise-sensitive components like sensors and microcontrollers.


System Control & Monitoring:

Onboard voltage and current sensing for critical power rails.

CAN bus interface to the VCU to monitor and control the entire LV system.

Diagnostics & Serviceability:

Onboard status LEDs for quick debugging of power rails and system health.

Special slots for critical components, allowing for rapid replacement if a part is damaged.
